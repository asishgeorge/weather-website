## API Keys

This project uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get weather data. You will need to create an account and get an API key to use this API.

Once you have an API key, create a `config.js` file in the root directory of the project and add the following code:

```
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.
